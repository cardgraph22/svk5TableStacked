# Responsive Table

A simple tailwind (daisy ui) table that stacks content on smaller screens.  
The idea is to stack related items in the same column,  with the goal of viewing all the data without having to do any interaction, such as scrolling or having to click some 'More' button or chevron.   
This was made using Sveltekit v5.
